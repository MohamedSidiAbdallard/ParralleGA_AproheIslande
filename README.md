# Parallel and distributed genetic algorithms
## "ISLAND MODEL" APPROACH
The implementation of genetic algorithms using the "island model" 
approach involves creating multiple subpopulations that evolve independently 
and occasionally exchange individuals to explore different solutions efficiently.
